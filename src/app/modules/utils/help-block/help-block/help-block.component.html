        The current version of the platform supports the following plugin options:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Portal</b> (portal APIUI application) is a rich custom Web application for interactive interaction with the end-user. This application assumes the presence of a GUI user interface, the development of which begins with a blank canvas, on which the developer can place various interface elements to implement business logic through calls to the backend of the platform, namely backend plug-ins. Data type  the interaction is trusted, and the Canvas diagram is reflected as a Trusted application. A distinctive feature of these applications is the presence of a user configuration for accessing on-premises data located in the perimeter of the end user's enterprise. This approach ensures that various requirements for personal data protection are met in cases where data stored in the cloud is impossible or undesirable. An example of a plugin of this type is the <a href="https://github.com/mef-dev/tutorial-ui-plugin" target="_blank"> tutorial-ui-plugin </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Canvas</b> (UI canvas app) is a simple Web application that implements an integrated interaction of different Web services within a single user interface. Typically used as an interactive tool on a secure website that provides a layout of both linked and unrelated external Web applications, services, and links. Portal applications focus on providing data in an easy-to-understand format and implement business logic changes or manipulations with data without access to the server part of the platform (do not require the presence of backend plugins) and are simplified versions of the portal application. Examples of this type of plugin are  <a href="https://github.com/mef-dev/simple-ui-plugin-calculator" target="_blank"> simple-ui-plugin-calculator </a>  and <a href="https://github.com/mef-dev/ui-plugin-example" target="_blank"> ui-plugin-example </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>A model-driven API</b> (backend API app) is a software server application whose functions or behavior are based on or controlled by some evolutionary application models of target things (entities). As the basis of the platform's reference architecture, entity application models are available as a public part of the export of a loosely coupled approach to programming. It is essential to understand that shared information and data models are standardized and standardized and  are serviced on the platform side as the main elements of the dynamic composition. They can be changed during the execution of the application. A distinctive feature of these applications is the ability to automatically generate the source code of the application after changing models and the ability to use a custom configuration to access local data located in the perimeter of the end user's enterprise. An example of a plugin of this type is the <a href="https://github.com/mef-dev/model-first-backend-plugin" target="_blank"> model-first-backend-plugin </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>A service </b> (microservice API) is a stand-alone server application in which all application functionality runs as an independent service. This architectural type allows each service to evolve or be updated without disrupting other applications in the platform because it does not involve integration at the level of loosely coupled code. A distinctive feature of these applications is that there is no user configuration to access the user's local data and implements  A request-response approach to interoperability for the use of external, independent functions.
